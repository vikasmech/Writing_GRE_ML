One of the source for GRE is Magoosh. 
especially its vocabulary app.
Manhattan is also great source 

I will focus on English more but Quant is also necessary.
Verbal is divided into 3 part. 
1) Text Completion 
2) Sentence Equivalence 
3) Reading Comprehension 

for Quant Data interpretation is one thing i want to cover.
I need to increase my speed as well as my accuracy.
Apart from this three there are Analytical Writing part thats is also come under the purview of english.
